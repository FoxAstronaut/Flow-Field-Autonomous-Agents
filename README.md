# Flow Field - Autonomous Agents
## Intro
This project is very much based off Daniel Shiffman's The Nature Of Code Chapter 6 which discusses Autonomous Agents. I'd highly recommend reading his book if you haven't yet. Available at: http://natureofcode.com/
## Flow Field
A flow field, also known as a vector field is a grid of vectors pointing in random directions, in this case they have a preference to point right to create a less random and more coherent flow.
## Autonomous Agents
Autonomous agents are intelligent entities that run without interference from the user. In this case, the agents have very simple physics. The flow field dictates the direction that the agents head in creating the pattern that can be seen.
